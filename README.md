# Quacker (X)
This project serves as a rebuild of [Quacker](https://github.com/QuackerApp/Quacker) as a PWA.

The project goals are simple:
Build a lightweight SNS client for reading.

This doesn't mean I won't add posting functionality, though it won't be the main focus of the app.

# License
As the project is still in development, I am not adding a license until it is in a usable state. If you want to suggest a license that you would like for the project, contact [@quackerx.harljo.uk](https://bsky.app/profile/quackerx.harljo.uk) on Bluesky.

Thank you for checking out this super unfinished project!
Any stars/forks would be appreciated <3
